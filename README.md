# Keylogger
The following program is a keylogger that records the keystrokes of a user's computer before relaying them back to a potential attacker through a Discord Webhook

The program was created using Python using the pynput library and allows a potential attacker to exploit a user's keystrokes to discover confidential information such as being used for credential harvesting. The project was built with the goal of continuing to practice malicious tools in the Cybersecurity industry
